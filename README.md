  On the occasion of World Health Day, I am sharing my first “End to End Machine Learning Model” on Predict - Heart Disease. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. Early diagnosis of such a disease is a crucial task for many health care providers to prevent their patients for such a disease and to save lives. 
  
  In recent years, practitioners have increased their usage of computer technologies to improve decision-making support. In the health care industry, machine learning is becoming an important solution to aid the diagnosis of patients. Machine learning is an analytical tool used when a task is large and difficult to program, such as transforming medical record into knowledge, pandemic predictions, and genomic data analysis.

  Seven months ago, I have done a Machine Learning Project : Predict Heart Disease to fulfil my Machine Learning Intermediate Assignment for Data Science course. Please find the link to know in details : https://www.linkedin.com/posts/narayan-rao-sameni-43358935_machinelearning-python-healthcare-activity-6712044096799694848-__qt

From the ML Project Assignment - Key Insights :-
  1.	68.32% of Males are getting affected by Heart Diseases.
  2.	Age group 41 to 54 are more risk.
  3.	The Coefficient of Correlation is very high for these 4 features - Chest Pain, Max Heart Rate, Slope of ST Segment & Electrocardiographic Result features are helping to  predict heart disease.
  4.	Random Forest & KNN model giving more accuracy i.e. 88.52% for predicting Heart Disease, whereas Logistic Regression is giving an accuracy of 85.25%.

I have developed the End to End ML Classification Model and Deployed for external use : 
  •	Problem Statement
  •	Data Source – Kaggle Dataset on Heart Disease
  •	Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  •	Prepare Data for the Classification Model (Standardize/Encoding)
  •	Building Model & Evaluation
  •	Deployment for End User – Using Flask & Heroku
